# Bike Sharing Predictions with Neural Networks 

In this project, I build, train, validate, and test a neural network from scratch using the popular Bike-Sharing dataset. 

- Goal - to predict daily bike rental ridership based on a number of factors, including:
    - Date
    - Season
    - Temperature
    - Windspeed
